                            Not all products are created equal. While we repeatedly buy some products almost mindlessly, for others, we take a lot of time to make a purchasing decision. 
                            For a price tag that meets a certain threshold or if we are particularly invested in the quality of a product, we want to be absolutely certain that we are 
                            making the right choice and are getting a good product for a good price. That's where a feature comparison table makes all the difference.

                            Feature comparison tables are helpful not only in their primary function, though. When designed properly, they can aid in decision-making way beyond placing 
                            product specifications side by side. They can also add meaning to an otherwise too technical product specification sheet, explaining why a certain feature 
                            is relevant to the customer or how a certain product is better than the others.
